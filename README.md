## My process
- Scrimba gave skellton of HTML, CSS and JS start.
- Utilized JS to get songs to play on click of button.
- Then changed with own HTML, CSS.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- JavaScript

### What I learned
Learned how to utilize a fuction with an id within the function.  And that when deploying to Netlify, need to pay attention with the repository fork.

Help with writing markdown, check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Continue to learn more about API's to make this more dynamic.

### Useful resources
